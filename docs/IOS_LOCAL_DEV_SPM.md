general outline

* SPM wants the Package.swift file at top level in the repo
* Run ./gradlew assmble... (whatever the task is called) to build local (we're going to improve this later, but for now just document)
* Drag whole folder in. Point out that the module that was shown in project navigator should "disappear"
* Strong reminder to remove before committing. State we are thinking through commit checks to prevent this
